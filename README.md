# mt7610u-linksys-ae6000-wifi-fixes

This currently works on my Centos 7 with kernel:

    Linux 3.10.0-327.36.3.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Oct 24 16:09:20 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Install:

    - make clean
    - make
    - sudo make install

Trying to fix the MT7610U chipset driver by MediaTek so it's usable on modern Linux kernels and with nl80211/NetworkManager (and not completely breaking on old ones, maybe...).

Based on the driver from the HPRATH site (thank you!)
http://hprath.com/2014/06/cisco-linksys-ae6000-ac580-media-tek-mt7610u-mt7630u-mt7650u-linux-x64-driver-patch/

Some of the issues, such as a WPA supplicant issue, are fixable by comparing MT7610U and MT7612U code from MediaTek.

# Note
- Regretfully I have moved and didn't bring this adapter with me, so I have not been able to handle the issues. The 'configless' branch contains a version that works without using the conf file but may not compile right now.
- The good news is that 'master' branch should be working with kernel 4.7 now. Thank you for the pull request.

# Features
- Linux kernel 4.7 support
- Works with 2.4/5GHz networks out of the box
- Works with NetworkManager and nl80211 interface out of the box
- Works with WPA2-Personal and WPA supplicant/NetworkManager without extra configuration
- rmmod isn't locked while driver is running and clean-up is better (work in progress)

# Building
- sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
- make clean
- make
- sudo make install

# Building with DKMS
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install dkms  # if you've already installed dkms, skip this step.
$ sudo cp -R . /usr/src/mt7610u_sta-1.0
$ sudo dkms add mt7610u_sta/1.0
$ sudo dkms build mt7610u_sta/1.0
$ sudo dkms install mt7610u_sta/1.0
```

-	I have added all the devices from here, but it doesn't necessarily mean they will all work

# Major bugs fixed in original driver
#### If you have these issues, then this driver might fix the problem.
- Keeps getting Disassociation with ReasonCode=1(Unspecified) while connecting to WPA2 AP
- NetworkManager keeps asking for password even though password is correct
- wpa_supplicant debug mode error:  No wpa_ie set - cannot generate msg 2/4
- Nothing works if /etc is on BTRFS (because DAT file could not be read)

# TODO
- Remove excessive logging
- Allow operation without DAT file
- Add other dev ids
- Try to get AP mode working (huge project?)
- Test other encryption modes like WEP, WPA2-Enterprise, etc.
- Using -Dwext with wpa_supplicant seems to reveal a warning (WARN_ON(!bss) kernel 3.11 ~net/wireless/sme.c:658 __cfg80211_connect_result+0x24f/0x346) in the driver, which was probably there originally

# Other
- Please submit patches or let me know of anything missing or not working
- I also don't know the code very well, but have been working on comparing MT7610U and MT7612U code to find out-of-date portions in the MT7610U driver
